# Omnivox Scrapper
Omnivox scrapper is a tool that scrapes the subdomains of omnivox.ca.
Most (possibly all) CEGEPs in quebec use omnivox, and it's a pain in the ass to navigate.
So, I made this tool to scrape it.

## Development
This API is currently still under development.
Currently, I'm working on migrating from the old codebase (which was only there for testing purposes)
to something designed to actually function as an API.

## Disclaimer
- No functionality defined in the current state of the API is guaranteed to make it into the final version.
- Functionality may be changed or removed without any prior notice and at any time.

## Running Tests
To run the tests, you must set `omnivox_username` and `omnivox_password` in `gradle.properties`.
